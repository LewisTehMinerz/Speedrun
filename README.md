# Speedrun
Race against time to get out of the facility before you die! But be careful, MTF are waiting to kill you!

## About
Speedrun is a gamemode that I am writing for SCP:SL for [Centurion](https://discord.gg/UrEAY9z). It's about getting out of the facility as fast as you can while evading the MTF who are out there to kill you.

The premise of the gamemode is this:
- You have 5 minutes to do what you need to do in LCZ before it gets decontaminated (so upgrading, etc.).
- You have 10 minutes in total to escape the facility before it gets blown up.
- You have all of the round to either escape or kill MTF if you're Class-D, otherwise you have to kill all Class-D. If they escape, they become Chaos Insurgency and are more likely to kill you.

**The gamemode is in a very early alpha stage. It is very buggy. I do not suggest running it on a public server unless you are willing to experience bugs while playing.**
